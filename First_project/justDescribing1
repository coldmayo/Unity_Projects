1.In this project I was trying to make the envirnment turn off the gravity control and watch the balls bounce around.
The balls were right next to each other and they were both blue. 

2.In this one we just knock down a thin capsule and using Rigidbody can see the capsule flip over.
The capsule is green and the cube is light blue.
